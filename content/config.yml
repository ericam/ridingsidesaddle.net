    body: "A really, really good reading time! Eric has gathered all of the beauteous, ugly, and necessary parts together in one place. The characters, ideas, story are exposed, raw, alive — merging masculine and feminine into some kind of mystical marriage. Graciously, Eric leaves us the pleasure of assembly without rules."

    body: "Rarely do you get to experience such intimate thoughts. It's like being dropped into someone's head, Quantum Leap style, for a transformative time in their life. Super sexy. I won't deny, it turned me&nbsp;on."
