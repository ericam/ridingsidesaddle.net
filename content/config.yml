    body: 'It’s a new, and wonderful, adventure each time, a story of outcasts, their caretaker, and the friendship and love they find with each other. It’s a story about the body and hybridity — based on the myth of Hermaphroditus — and it’s a story about magic and the slipperiness of categories.'

    body: "A really, really good reading time! Eric has gathered all of the beauteous, ugly, and necessary parts together in one place. The characters, ideas, story are exposed, raw, alive — merging masculine and feminine into some kind of mystical marriage. Graciously, Eric leaves us the pleasure of assembly without rules."

    body: "Rarely do you get to experience such intimate thoughts. It's like being dropped into someone's head, Quantum Leap style, for a transformative time in their life. Super sexy. I won't deny, it turned me&nbsp;on."

    body: "This feels more realistic than any other novel could hope to be: every moment is just one in a sea of other moments, no more or less important, although no less interesting for that. The result is an impressionist array of feelings and emotions and understandings of oneself and others."
